✨Code-Alpha-Intership✨
  I am currently doing my 3-month internship at Code Alpha, where I am building Python projects to strengthen my programming skills. 
  
TASK 1: Hangman Game
Goal: Create a text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.
Simplified Scope:
Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no file or API).
Limit incorrect guesses to 6.
Basic console input/output (no graphics/audio).
Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists

TASK 2: Stock Portfolio Tracker
Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock prices.
Simplified Scope:
User inputs stock names and quantity.
Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., "AAPL": 188, "TSLA":250).
Display total investment value.
Optionally save results in a.txt or .csv file.
